# Aware Agent Development Guide

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide for the development and implementation of the Aware Agent system. This system is designed to be an intelligent agent that can understand, process, and respond to user queries in a context-aware manner.

### 1.2 Scope
The Aware Agent system will be developed as a Python-based application with the following key components:
- Semantic Abstraction Layer
- Agent Orchestration Layer
- Interaction Engine
- Memory Engine
- Execution Layer

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SAL**: Semantic Abstraction Layer
- **AOL**: Agent Orchestration Layer
- **IE**: Interaction Engine
- **ME**: Memory Engine
- **EL**: Execution Layer
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing
- **LLM**: Large Language Model

### 1.5 Overview
The rest of this document is organized as follows:
- Section 2 describes the overall system architecture
- Section 3 details the specific requirements for each component
- Section 4 provides implementation guidelines
- Section 5 covers testing and validation procedures

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 System Context
The Aware Agent system will operate as a standalone service that can be integrated with other applications through a REST API. It will use various external services and libraries for its functionality.

### 2.2 System Components
The system consists of the following main components:

#### 2.2.1 Semantic Abstraction Layer (SAL)
- Responsible for understanding and processing natural language input
- Uses NLP techniques to extract semantic meaning
- Implements the Karaka grammar system for role mapping

#### 2.2.2 Agent Orchestration Layer (AOL)
- Manages the coordination between different components
- Handles task planning and execution
- Implements decision-making logic

#### 2.2.3 Interaction Engine (IE)
- Manages user interactions
- Handles prompt construction and response translation
- Implements feedback mechanisms

#### 2.2.4 Memory Engine (ME)
- Stores and retrieves context and action history
- Implements persistence mechanisms
- Handles context cleanup and retention

#### 2.2.5 Execution Layer (EL)
- Executes specific tasks and actions
- Manages resources and parallel execution
- Implements caching and optimization

### 2.3 Data Flow
1. User input is received through the API
2. SAL processes the input and extracts semantic meaning
3. AOL plans and coordinates the response
4. IE constructs the appropriate response
5. ME stores the interaction context
6. EL executes any required actions
7. Response is returned to the user
